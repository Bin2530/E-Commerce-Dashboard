Data and Exploration
- 3 datasets were (List of Orders, Order details, and Sales Target) cleaned and analyzed using MS EXCEL.
- The Tabes are as follows:-
- List of Orders : (City, CustomerName, Month, Order Date, Order Duration, Order ID, State and Year)
- Order Details : (Amount, Avg_Price, Category, Order ID and Profit)
- Sales Target : (Category, Month, Month of order date, Order_Duration, Target, and Year)

**Important steps were done during the data cleaning and analysis in Excel.**

1. Extracting the MONTH and YEAR from the Order Date column in the LIST OF ORDERS CSV file
   =MONTH(B2) and =Year(B2) --->> joining the month and year (=F2& "-" &G2)
2. Checking for the Duplicate Values [DATA >> DATA TOOLS]
3. Using a filter, check for the NULL VALUES.
